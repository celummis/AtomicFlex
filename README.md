# AtomicFlex
AtomicFlex is Sass Atomic Design. This approach uses Sass variables and mixins as the atoms. The SCSS file
gives you the building blocks for designing any CSS framework system that fits the application or website you are building.

Instead of using a framework that requires you to follow certain CSS class naming guideline, you can create your own flexible framework.
