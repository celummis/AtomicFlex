# AtomicFlex

AtomicFlex is Sass Atomic Design. This approach uses Sass variables as the atoms, and Sass mixins for molecules. These two Sass files 
gives you the building blocks for designing any CSS framework system that fits the application or website you are building. 

Develop only the CSS you need after you @import the "reset.scss" and "molecules.scss" into your styles.scss file. The "atoms.scss" is the @import in the molecules.scss file.
