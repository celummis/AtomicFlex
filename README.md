# AtomicFlex
Atomic Flex is a CSS framework using "atoms" of "Atomic Design" with the flexibility of flexbox.

Atomic Flex is not a "design system."

Instead, Atomic Flex allows you to prototype any design or concept without writing design CSS.

Use code to sketch or draw prototypes using front-end code.

These are the sections of the CSS

1. Universal reset (essentially no styles)
2. Colors
3. Typography (www.modularscale.com)
3. Elements (forms, images, icons, links, tables, lists)
5. Positioning
6. Grid (flexbox)
7. Utility (layout, margin, padding)

*You could @import this CSS file into a LessCSS file.
