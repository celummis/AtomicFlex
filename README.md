# AtomicFlex
AtomicFlex is Sass Atomic Design. This approach uses Sass variables as the atoms, and Sass mixins for molecules. These two Sass files 
give you the building blocks for designing any CSS framework system that fits the application or website you are building. 

Instead of using a framework that requires you to follow certain CSS class naming guideline, you can create your own. 

Design a CSS framework that fits to your design system and the CSS naming conventions of that system. Rather than conforming your design system to the CSS framework you are using.

Or, use the AtomicFlex "atoms.scss," if you do not want to mess around with creating CSS framework.

The "AtomicFlex.scss" generates CSS that can build any UI design. This approach is one where multiple single purpose CSS classes are used to style a UI component. Instead of multiple CSS properties for one CSS UI component class. 

If you like semantic CSS, then this framework is not for you. 

I developed this CSS framework because I wanted one CSS file that would enable me to quickly prototype a UI design in code.
